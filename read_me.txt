Golden section search is a method for finding an optimal point (minimum or maximum) of a function inside a specified interval(strictly for unimodal models.
It is an efficient way to progressively reduce the interval locating the minimum. It uses the golden ratio which is said to be 1.618033.
This algorithm uses this optimization method to search elements in an sorted array. The complexity of this algorithm varies between O(1) to O(log(n)).
Practically, it depends on the position of the element in the sorted array I tried for large number of elements and sometimes got impressive results. It was able to find a element in an array of 2,00,000 elements within 4 iterations. While at times I got bad result as number of iterations jumped to 15. Still it was worth, as at times it performed better than any other search algorithms.
